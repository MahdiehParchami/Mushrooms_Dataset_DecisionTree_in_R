# Mushrooms_Dataset_DecisionTree_in_R
Implementing Decision tree machine learning model on Mushrooms dataset in R

I use a Mushrroms dataset to perform data mining technicks. the dataset consists of  23 columns and 8124 rows, and all our variables are types of “Character”.

Based on the result of our analysis, we can simply detect Mushrooms classification by using just “odor, spore-print-color, population, habit, and gill-size” 
attributes thanks to data mining methods. We found that the edible mushrooms have the odor of almond, anise, and odorless, a spore-print-color of buff chocolate, black, brown, 
orange, purple, and yellow. Their population is clustered, numerous, scattered, and solitary. Also, their gill size is broad, and their habitat is leaves and paths. 
Furthermore, the confusion Matrix shows we have perfect accuracy in our prediction model. As a result, to uncover meaningful trends and patterns from large blocks 
of information, data mining methods can be used.
